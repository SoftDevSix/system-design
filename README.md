## Advantages 

### Deep AST analysis: Allows inspection and manipulation of the internal structure of Java code, ideal for static analysis, refactoring and code generation.

### Automated refactoring: Provides advanced tools to refactor code in a safe and automated way, maintaining references and avoiding human errors.

### Compatibility with multiple Java versions: Supports multiple Java versions, including the latest ones, which facilitates the development and maintenance of old or new projects.

### Full Eclipse integration: Fully integrated into the Eclipse IDE, providing a smooth development experience with tools such as auto-completion, debugging and testing.

### Extensibility through plugins: An extensible platform that allows developers to add specific functionality through a wide variety of plugins.

### High performance in large projects: Optimized to handle large-scale projects, with efficient analysis and good memory management.

### Disadvantages

### High learning curve: Advanced AST analysis and manipulation capabilities can be complex for novice or inexperienced Eclipse developers.

### High resource consumption: In very large or complex projects, memory and CPU consumption can increase significantly, impacting IDE performance.

### Dependency on the Eclipse ecosystem: It is strongly tied to the Eclipse IDE, which may limit its adoption if developers prefer other environments such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code.
