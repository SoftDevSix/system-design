### Extensibility through plugins: An extensible platform that allows developers to add specific functionality through a wide variety of plugins.

### Support for enterprise projects: Compatible with enterprise Java technologies such as Java EE, Spring and Maven, facilitating the development of complex applications in corporate environments.

### Disadvantages

### High learning curve: Advanced AST analysis and manipulation capabilities can be complex for novice or inexperienced Eclipse developers.

### High resource consumption: In very large or complex projects, memory and CPU consumption can increase significantly, impacting IDE performance.

### Dependency on the Eclipse ecosystem: It is strongly tied to the Eclipse IDE, which may limit its adoption if developers prefer other environments such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code.
